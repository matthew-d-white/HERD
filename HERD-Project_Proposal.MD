**Research Proposal: HERD - Heterogeneous Experts with Routed Decisions**

**1. Introduction**

The HERD project proposes a novel approach to building an **Ensemble of Experts** architecture specifically designed for **multi-model, multi-modal applications**. HERD aims to leverage the advantages of multiple specialized models, each an expert in a specific domain or modality, to achieve **high-quality, user-centric outputs**. By dynamically routing user prompts to the most appropriate experts, HERD seeks to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of model utilization compared to traditional architectures like the Mixture of Experts (MoE).

HERD stands for **Heterogeneous Experts with Routed Decisions**, highlighting the two main innovations of this architecture: the diversity of independent, domain-specific experts and the routing mechanism that optimally determines which experts to invoke. Unlike the MoE, HERD's **experts are independent models** that can be added, removed, or updated dynamically, enhancing scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.

**2. Motivation**

AI models today are increasingly tasked with complex, multi-modal challenges that require specialized domain knowledge. The traditional **Mixture of Experts** models have shown promise in improving model efficiency by selectively activating subsets of experts, but they face challenges such as **parameter entanglement** (parameters of one expert are dependent on other experts or shared parameters), lack of dynamic flexibility, and the computational burden of training a monolithic model.

HERD addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Heterogeneity**: Independent models as experts, each designed for specific tasks or modalities, allowing HERD to flexibly combine domain expertise.
- **Routing Decisions**: A **non-co-trained routing mechanism** that intelligently decides which experts to engage, optimizing computational resources and ensuring scalability.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Experts can be **loaded, unloaded, or upgraded dynamically**, allowing the architecture to evolve with new domain advances or application requirements.

**3. Key Features of HERD**

- **Independent Expert Models**: Each expert is a **stand-alone model** that specializes in a specific domain or modality. This approach contrasts with traditional MoE architectures, where experts are tightly integrated components.
- **Flexible Routing**: The routing component is decoupled from the training of expert models, acting as a centralized decision-maker based on input characteristics, thereby allowing **selective utilization of domain expertise** for the most effective processing.
- **Dynamic Scalability**: Experts can be dynamically added or removed from the ensemble, making HERD a **future-proof system** that can easily incorporate advances in specialized AI models.
- **Modality-Targeted Efficiency**: Designed for **multi-modal inputs** (e.g., text, images, videos, audio), HERD ensures that only the most relevant domain-specific models are activated for any given input, minimizing unnecessary computational load and improving processing speed.

**4. Architectural Overview**

HERD is composed of:

- **Expert Models**: Each expert is a specialized, self-contained model for a particular domain (e.g., object detection, translation, speech recognition, financial knowledge and tasks, mathematics, image generation, etc..).
- **Router Module**: The router dynamically assigns incoming queries to appropriate experts based on pre-defined decision criteria or a learned, adaptive strategy. Unlike MoE, the router is **not trained with the experts**, allowing independent evolution of routing strategies and model improvements.
- **Ensemble Coordinator**: This component aggregates outputs from multiple experts when a task requires contributions from different domains, ensuring seamless integration of diverse modalities.

**5. Expected Contributions**

The HERD project aims to contribute to the broader AI research community in several key ways:

- **Increased Efficiency**: By enabling dynamic expert utilization of reduced parameterized models and selective routing, HERD can significantly reduce computational and memory costs and improve the efficiency of multi-modal AI applications.
- **Modular Flexibility**: HERD's architecture is inherently **modular**, enabling researchers to work on upgrading individual experts without affecting the entire system.
- **Open-Source Development**: HERD is envisioned as an open research effort, inviting contributions from researchers to develop specialized experts, refine the routing mechanism, and build new capabilities for multi-modal data.

**6. Invitation to Collaborate**

We believe that HERD has the potential to revolutionize **multi-modal AI architectures** by blending scalability, efficiency, and adaptability into a unified framework. We are seeking researchers with expertise in areas such as **model ensembling, mixture of experts, multi-modal learning, reinforcement learning**, and **routing algorithms** to collaborate on this exciting project.

Together, we can:

- Develop and benchmark novel **expert models** for various domains and tasks.
- Innovate on the **routing strategies**, including reinforcement learning approaches to optimize decision-making.
- Explore **multi-modal integration** to efficiently combine the knowledge of different domains.

If you are interested in advancing the state of AI through an **adaptive, scalable architecture**, we invite you to join us in bringing HERD to life. Your expertise could play a crucial role in shaping the future of ensemble learning and domain specialization in AI.

Please reach out to discuss potential collaborations and contributions to HERD. We are excited to work with like-minded researchers and build a community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what multi-model AI systems can achieve.
